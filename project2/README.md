## Milestone notes

I tried to complete the milestone in Go, but trying to complete the milestone in Go just proved that I should not use Go. I ran into too many issues with the CCIS machines, TA's not knowing Go and those that do not being helpful.

Using Go with CCIS machines just seems to give me error after error. I genuinly spent a week just debugging errors with Go and CCIS machines not working well together. Using go run or go build give erros because I am not allowed to make a certain number of running processes or threads, which I guess Go is doing in the background somehow. I did not ever code any goroutines so this is a mystery to me. I managed to get it to work by limiting the number of proccesses the program can start, but then I just got another error and at some point it became too much. 


Most TA's/tutors do not know Go, so any error at all baffles them and they won't bother to help. To be fair they can't, so I'm not too mad. One TA does know Go, but he is busy and didn't really do what I needed him to do when I talked to him. He also doesn't really answer piazza questions. 

So, I'm frustrated I spent a week on this and now I'm switching to Python. Also frustrated I am getting a 0 because all of these things were out of my control.
