## Project 1 ReadMe

The trickiest part of this assignment was learning how to use Golang since I had never worked in that language before. The actual assignment was not very difficult. Counting the number of instances of a particular character in a string was not hard. It was more just time consuming learning about all the libraries I needed in order to do the assignment. For example I needed to learn about the net package in order to connect to a TCP socket and I needed to learn about the flag package to handle command line arguments properly. 

Most of the net package methods in Go naturally return an error message as a second argument. So a simple if statement checking to make sure no error was returned was sufficient.
